## Description Extract-Links
  This project is just to improve the knowledge about libs, but it is not a truly one. Extract-Links can find links only in markdown files from a diretory called **dir**. It's possible to put multiples files and all will be read. 
  In addition, it can show the status code of those links or if that link does not exist. This programming has no unit testing, however, functions have been applied to handle possible errors.
  
## Getting Started
- To see links in a file, put that file in directory called **dir**, than run `npm run cli ./dir/`
- to see if those links are validate run `npm run cli ./dir/ valida`
#### Obs.:
You will receive a error that can help you if something was wrong.
